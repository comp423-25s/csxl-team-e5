## Overview

CourseSeek is a chatbot feature for the CSXL website that allows users to describe the kind of Computer Science course they are looking for and receive input about what courses fit that description. This was built with the intention to help computer science students in getting the most out of their time at UNC Chapel Hill by assisting them in finding courses that appeal to their interests and provide practical value to them personally.
